2004-08-27: 
 - added Ariel Arjona's code to resolve compile problems due to missing/incorrect headers
 - added code based on Jorge Jimenez's patch to support non-standard sockets and ports
 - released updated copy as version 2.0.0 (new version numbering system to match other projects)

2004-09-08: (Version 2.5.0)
 merged in code based on contribuited patches:
 - added AuthMySQLPort and AuthMySQLSocket options based on patches by Douglas Maske and Jorge Jimenez
 - added missing #include statements based on patch by Ariel Arjona

2004-09-21: (Version 2.6.0)
 - fixed error when compiling for Apache 1.x.
 - rewrote some of the code to get rid of many of the #ifdef statements
 - added code based on Andrew Gwozdziewycz's patch to enable AuthMySQLSaltField
 - added code based on Hatamoto's patch to enable AuthMySQLEnable   
 - added new parameter AuthMySQLPwEncryption to set encryption type
 - depricated the following parameters:
 
   AuthMySQLCryptedPasswords
   AuthMySQLScrambledPasswords
   AuthMySQLMD5Passwords

 - added compile time default values for the following configuration paramters:

  Configuration Parameter		Option
  -----------------------		------
  AuthMySQLHost			HOST
  AuthMySQLPort			PORT
  AuthMySQLSocket			SOCKET
  AuthMySQLUser			USER
  AuthMySQLPassword			PASSWORD
  AuthMySQLDB				DB
  AuthMySQLPwTable			PWTABLE	
  AuthMySQlNameField			NAMEFIELD
  AuthMySQLPasswordField		PASSWORDFIELD
  AuthMySQLPwEncryption		ENCRYPTION
  AuthMySQLSaltField			SALT	
  AuthMySQLKeepAlive			KEEPALIVE
  AuthMySQLAuthoritative		AUTHORITATIVE	
  AuthMySQLNoPassword			NOPASSWORD
  AuthMySQLEnable			ENABLE

 - Removed requirement to define APACHE1 on command line for Apache 1.x
   (now the default). 
   
2004-10-04: (Version 2.6.1)
 - Changed code to return immediately when module is disabled

2004-10-20: (Version 2.7.0)
 - Changed authorization code to process "require user" and "require group" correctly

2004-12-07: (Version 2.8.0)
 - Separated documentiation into multiple files
 - Updated all documentation
 - Added support for AES_ENCRYPT encryption
 - Added support for SHA1 encryption based on code by Matthew Sullivan 

2004-12-14 (Version 2.8.1)
 - Changed code to require a compile time parameter to include AES encryption
 - Fixed a minor bug in handling of the AuthMySQLSaltField for AES encryption

2005-02-21 (Version 2.9.0)
 - Restructured the password encryption code into functions based on encyption scheme
 - Fixed bug caused by new scrambled password algorithm in MySQL 4.1
 - Added formatting parameters to the AuthMySQLUserCondition and AuthMySQLGroupCondition
   to allow comparisons against information from the request (thanks to Guido Smit)
 - Added new parameter AuthMySQLCharacterSet (and compile time parameter CHARACTERSET)
   to override the default character set used for MySQL connections (thanks to Alex Stanciu)
 - Fixed a bug in the password hashing mechanism.  This only affects MySQL 4.1 and later
   using PASSWORD encryption

2005-6-22 (version 3.0.0)
 - Fixed a bug when using AES encryption
 - Added new parameter AuthMySQLGroupUserNameField to specify the user name field in the group table
 - Changed the default include file for the crypt() function to the newer unistd.h file (the old
   crypt.h file can still be included - see the instructions in the BUILD file)
 - Added code to allow comparing to stored cookies 
 - Performance improvement. Module will no longer reselect the database if the same one is being
   used for multiple requests.  Note that if a second copy of the module is initialized by Apache,
   we will still need to connect and select the database.
 - Removed the AuthMySQLKeepAlive parameter, which doesn't work and causes problems.
